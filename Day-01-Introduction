This is the first day of 137 days of code with AlmaBetter Full Stack Development Course.
Day 01-Introduction

Today, I studied the basics of web development. I understood what full stack development means, front-end (client-side) and back-end(sever-side).
Types of Full Stack Development:
1 MERN (MongoDB,Express.js,React.js,Node)
2 MEAN (MongoDB,Express.js,Angular,Node)
3 LAMP (Linux,Apache,MySQL)

IP address is an unique identification for websites which was replaced by domain names later which we have to buy when we want to host our website.
Server Hosting is the process of making our website accessible on internet.





Excited to begin my 137 Days of Code journey! 🚀
